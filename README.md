### Welcome to my profile

If you have any issues with my projects, don't hesitate to send a issue. I do respond to issues no matter what repo you send it. Doesn't matter if it is a feature request or a tiny issue, just send it!

With that out of the way, hello! I make programs I personally use and upload them to the internet.  

### Original project highlights

Most of my repos I made in high school. I will mostly host my future ones on the [SimpleOpenApps](https://github.com/simpleopenapp) org.
- [Killswitch](https://github.com/Epicminer256/Killswitch)
    - A server that can deploy a Chromebook "Webapp" to kill Securly, the school blocker extension
        - The "Webapp" is disguised to look like Google. You launch it by right clicking the app. 
        - The "Webapp" is actually a cached website, so it is offline.
        - Not actively maintaining, but will respons to issues
    - Used a cookie spam technique found in [Killcurly](https://github.com/zek-c/Securly-Kill-V111) ([My forked ver here](https://github.com/Epicminer256/Securascramble)) to make securly not respond back to requests.
    - Don't have securly anymore, but I will still respond to issues anyways
- [iCustomCue](https://github.com/Epicminer256/iCustomCue)
    - A dotNet app that allows for Corshair headset's to have a custom voice on them.
    - I use this program, I will 100% actively maintain it
- [hooplaCompiler](https://github.com/Epicminer256/hooplaCompiler)
    - Python tool 
    - Links or JS files -> Bookmark File.
- [RethinkAPI](https://github.com/Epicminer256/RethinkAPI)
    - Python Library for interfacing with YHS's "Rethink"
    - Powers [Glasscord](https://github.com/Epicminer256/glasscord), which is a Discord bot for Rethink
    - Don't use Rethink anymore, but I will respond to issues anyways.
- [jscap](https://github.com/Epicminer256/jscap)
    - View capture cards with sound in the browser
        - Useful for using Chromebooks as monitors
        - Capture cards are really cheap! Super cheap portable monitor solution
    - I will 100% respond to issues, just feature updates may take some time because I have other things. Don't be afraid to ask for some though.
- [SimpleOpenApps](https://github.com/simpleopenapps)
    - Github Organization I founded (if you want to join, don't be afraid to ask)
    - Made because I value:
        - Code that can be reviewed and modified by anyone
        - Good user experience
            - Setup doesn't get in the way
            - Programs work as efficent as possiable
        - Good graphic design
            - Boring programs are boring :(
